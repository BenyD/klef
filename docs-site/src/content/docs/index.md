description: What Klef is, who it is for, and what it deliberately is not.
---

Klef keeps your `.env` files in sync across machines, end-to-end encrypted. You paste or push a file in, and pull it back down on another machine. The files are encrypted on your device, in the browser or the CLI, before they are uploaded. The server stores ciphertext it cannot decrypt.

There are two ways in:

- **The web app** at [klef.sh](https://klef.sh). Paste an env file, review a line-level diff against the stored version, save. Every save is a new version you can go back to.
- **The CLI**, [`@klefsh/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@klefsh/cli). One command links a repo, pulls the files that are missing and teaches Claude Code and Cursor how to use it. After that, `klef sync` keeps `.env.local` and `.env.production` in step with the vault.

## Who it is for

Klef is for one developer with several machines and a pile of env files: the files you would otherwise move around with AirDrop, a Slack DM to yourself, or a gist. It is free, open source under [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/BenyD/klef/blob/main/LICENSE), and you can [host it yourself](/docs/guides/self-hosting/) on your own Cloudflare account.

It is also built for working with coding agents. The CLI never prints a secret value, so an agent such as Claude Code or Cursor can run it without a value ever entering the conversation.

## What it is not

Klef is deliberately not a team secrets manager in the mould of Doppler, Infisical or HashiCorp Vault. It has:

- no team access control or shared vaults
- no machine-to-machine secret injection for CI or production
- no always-on daemon or file watcher

Those products serve plaintext to machines, which needs a server that can read your secrets. Klef gives that up for one property: the server cannot read them, whoever runs it.

## The model in one paragraph

Signing in (Google, GitHub or a passkey) proves who you are and gets you to your ciphertext. A separate **master passphrase**, which never leaves your device, unlocks the data. Workspace, project and file names are stored in plaintext so the app can show them to you; the contents of every file are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. If you lose both your passphrase and your recovery key, the data cannot be recovered by anyone, Klef included. See [End-to-end encryption](/docs/concepts/encryption/) for the details.
